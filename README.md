I am a recent grad of Flatiron School specializing in software engineering and developement. Before that I had a background as a professional stage actor after graduating from Marymount Manhattan College in 2014 with a Bachelor's degree in Theatre Arts and a minor in Musical theatre.

As a programmer, I have experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, React.js, Bootstrap, SQL, PostgresSQL, RSpec, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, ActiveRecord, and Object-Oriented Programming methodology. I also have experience with Logic Pro and Davinci Resolve softwares.

I am mainly looking for Frontend Software Development roles, but I also have a big interest in Full Stack Development as well. I am very passionate about expanding my coding knowledge, both in terms of growing my skills in the languages I already know, as well as learning entriely new languages and code bases!
